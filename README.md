### WHY I PAUSED

بسم الله الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام علي رسول الله وبعد

I stopped here at this point in the project because I added another experience of writing an http server
in another programming language and it is important that I fully master Java development as it seems that
that is the language with the most jobs out of the gate.

If I decide to continue, the project should contine from cmd/web/templates.go, I had started implementing a
cache, and I have stopped on page 191 in the book where it last read: 

> "The next step is to initialize this cache in the main() function and make it available to our handlers as a
> dependency via the application struct, like this..."
